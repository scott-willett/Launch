Changelog

V0.2 (06/12/2010) - Added 'commands.sh' to be run from a template directory at the end of the launch command
V0.1 (06/12/2010) - Initial version

Description

Launch is a Ruby on Rails app template creator. It lets you create public files, a main layout (application.html.erb), and a Gemfile to quickly create a new rails app for a showoff prototype, for faster development, or for automatically doing tedious tasks when creating a new rails app (eg: adding authentication, bundling gems, creating a common model or scaffold).<br /> Runs good on Ubuntu, haven't tested on any other platforms.

Please email me if you have any suggestions, want to contribute etc. Keep in mind I only started working on this on 06/12 for 4 hours and have never created a bash script before.

Usage

This app is setup ideally for Ubuntu. Place the 'launch' directory in your home folder. Feel free to place the folder elsewhere, but you will have to update setup.sh and launch.sh to point to the right directories.

sh setup.sh

Uncomment the appropriate code to replace the rails scaffold template.
This command will create a symbolic link and  allow the command below to be used.

launch App_Name Template

App_Name = The name of the new rails app you wish to create
Template = Name of the launch template to use. If the param isn't specified, the 'default' template is used.

eg: launch MyRailsApp
    launch MyRailsApp simple_template</pre>

ToDo

- Allow a file to be created in the template directory that runs custom commands after the main command
- Create a 'launch create template' command to take a snapshot of an apps files and place it in the launch directory
- Create a '-h' or '--help' or 'help' or 'about' (or all) for viewing help with the command
- Check if it works on a Mac
- Perhaps port the program to ruby, or as a gem/rails plugin
- Create some templates to provide quick examples<
- If this plugin is popular, create a website to host launch templates by other people
- Have an 'init' directory that has its files copied to a new template on creation (such as commands.sh)
- Include options to overwrite or delete directories or something
- Have an 'describe' file in each template so when 'launch template describe' is run it will echo information on the layout in the case where there are a heap load of templates and you forget the purpose of a template
- Get rails to auto create common variables you will use (eg: title, header) if it's useful
