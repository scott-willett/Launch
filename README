  <h2>Author</h2>

  <h2>Change Log</h2>
<pre>V0.2 (06/12/2010) - Added 'commands.sh' to be run from a template directory at the end of the launch command</pre>
<pre>V0.1 (06/12/2010) - Initial version</pre>
  <h2>Description</h2>
  Launch is a Ruby on Rails app template creator. It lets you create public files, a main layout (application.html.erb), and a Gemfile to quickly create a new rails app for a showoff prototype, for faster development, or for automatically doing tedious tasks when creating a new rails app (eg: adding authentication, bundling gems, creating a common model or scaffold).<br /> Runs good on Ubuntu, haven't tested on any other platforms.<br /><br />Please email me if you have any suggestions, want to contribute etc. Keep in mind I only started working on this on 06/12 for 4 hours and have never created a bash script before.
  <h2>Usage</h2>
<pre>
sh setup.sh

Uncomment the appropriate code to replace the rails scaffold template.
This command will create a symbolic link and  allow the command below to be used.

launch App_Name Template

App_Name = The name of the new rails app you wish to create
Template = Name of the launch template to use. If the param isn't specified, the 'default' template is used.

eg: launch MyRailsApp
    launch MyRailsApp simple_template</pre>
  <h2>ToDo</h2>
  <ul> 
    <li><del>Allow a file to be created in the template directory that runs custom commands after the main command</del></li>
    <li>Create a 'launch create template' command to take a snapshot of an apps files and place it in the launch directory</li>
    <li>Create a '-h' or '--help' or 'help' or 'about' (or all) for viewing help with the command</li>
    <li>Check if it works on a Mac</li>
    <li>Perhaps port the program to ruby, or as a gem/rails plugin</li>
    <li>Create some templates to provide quick examples</li>
    <li>If this plugin is popular, create a website to host launch templates by other people</li>
    <li>Have an 'init' directory that has its files copied to a new template on creation (such as commands.sh)</li>
    <li>Include options to overwrite or delete directories or something</li>
    <li>Have an 'describe' file in each template so when 'launch template describe' is run it will echo information on the layout in the case where there are a heap load of templates and you forget the purpose of a template</li>
    <li>Get rails to auto create common variables you will use (eg: title, header) if it's useful</li>
  </ul>
